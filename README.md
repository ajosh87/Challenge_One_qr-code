## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first ever HTML and CSS code as soon as I started learning them.

### Continued development

I wish to repeat this with REACT while I learn it. My idea would be to randomize the QR code each time the page is refereshed.
